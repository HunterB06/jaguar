## Tiger Compiler

The Tiger Compiler, also called `TC`, is a project aiming at the implementation
of a Tiger language compiler, in C++.

The compiler implementation is based on the book "Modern Compiler
Implementation" by Andrew W. Appel.

TC compiles Tiger source to:

* x86
* ARM
* MIPS

or `LLVM`, which allows us to target more architectures.
